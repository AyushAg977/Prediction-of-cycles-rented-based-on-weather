# Problem Statement
# 1 Introduction
This document contains 1 problems. The solution is expected to be submitted in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file). The notebook
should contain both the code and your explanations and comments. Please keep the answers,
approaches and explanations brief and up to the point. You are free to use whatever libraries
and tools you want (as long as itâ€™s python). If you are using functionality that is specific to a
particular version of a library or a particular version of python or if you are using some nonroutine libraries, please mention that explicitly. While solving a problem, if you feel the need
to make any other assumptions, you may do so freely, but please explicitly mention such
assumptions that you make. You can write any helper functions and so on that you think will
be useful.
Try to keep the cells of the Jupyter notebook arranged in the order in which they are to be
executed. Also try to keep descriptive variable names that are easy to understand.

**Note:** Logic is important along with attempt, you should use proper logic and approach
in order to arrive at the solution.
# QUESTION
A time series-based regression dataset, that has 21 input features and 1 target variable. Each
check point represents the number cycles that have been rented from that particular
checkpoint on the corresponding date and target is the sum of number of cycles that have
been rented on that particular date. In addition to that you are also provided with weather data
of the particular city. Also all the check points are in a single city for which weather data is
provided.
You need to analyse following mentioned points;
1. EDA on the data i.e. handling anomalous values, insights, etc.
2. Implement any of the deep learning based algorithms to achieve a good MAPE, and Error
performance.
3. If required you can use auto hyper parameter tuning algorithms along with the deep
learning algorithms.
